# CeZeY's Github Downloader

A github downloader for my repositories, dynamically finds any new repository i upload, and even checks the version if it's the latest one.

__Also can download a specific user's repository__

***If you get the download limit, you need to get a token (the app itself tells you where to get it), or https://github.com/settings/tokens then create with note name GHDownloader, don't check anything and expiration date is your choice***
